title: HyperMind
description: Reading a textbook is an important way to obtain new knowledge. However, students often avert their eyes from reading a textbook because it is static and boring. We are currently developing an intelligent textbook which displays descriptions and representations dynamically according to cognitive states of a reader (e.g., attention, understanding, concentration, workload) measured by eye movements.
